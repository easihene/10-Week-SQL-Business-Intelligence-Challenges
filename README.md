# 10-Week-SQL-Business-Intelligence-Challenges
This 10-week program provides a structured and engaging way for SQL users of all levels to develop their business intelligence skills through practical challenges. This program offers a progressive learning experience through real-world business intelligence (BI) scenarios across various industries. Each week focuses on a specific industry, presenting 10 business cases with varying difficulty levels to cater to beginners, intermediate, and advanced SQL users.

# Challenge Structure:

## Each week will include:

Industry Overview: A brief introduction to the chosen industry and its data landscape.
Sample Dataset: A representative dataset relevant to the industry will be provided. A Python script will be included for users to generate their dataset in csv format.
Data migration: Following the dataset generation, the participant can ingest the dataset into any database of their choice. However, in this code challenge, I used the Microsoft platform, including SQL-Server, SQL-Server Integration server (SSIS) and SSMS. A step-by-step tutorial has been provided to guide the user migrate the sampled dataset into a relational database (SQL-SERVER). The T-SQL syntax to create the database, schema, and tables has been provided so that participants can quickly write queries to address each business case.

## Business Cases (10 per week):

- Beginner (3 cases): Focus on basic querying skills like filtering, aggregation, and simple joins.
- Intermediate (4 cases): Introduce window functions, subqueries, and basic data manipulation techniques.
- Advanced (3 cases): Challenge participants with complex joins, data cleansing techniques, and advanced analytical functions.

## Additional Considerations:

- Each week can focus on a different industry like e-commerce, finance, healthcare, or education.
- The complexity of business cases will gradually increase throughout the program.
- Participants can share and discuss their approaches within a forum to enhance learning.

## Benefits:

By successfully completing this program, you will showcase your proficiency in writing effective SQL queries for real-world business intelligence scenarios. In addition, you will learn how to generate samples dataset of your choice with python and also, learn how to migrate the generated sampled datset in SQL-SERVER database.
