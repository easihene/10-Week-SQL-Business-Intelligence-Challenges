# 10-Week-SQL-Business-Intelligence-Challenges
This 10-week program provides a structured and engaging way for SQL users of all levels to develop their business intelligence skills through practical challenges. This program offers a progressive learning experience through real-world business intelligence (BI) scenarios across various industries. Each week focuses on a specific industry, presenting 10 business cases with varying difficulty levels to cater to beginners, intermediate, and advanced SQL users.

# Challenge Structure:

## Each week will include:

Industry Overview: A brief introduction to the chosen industry and its data landscape.
Sample Dataset: A representative dataset relevant to the industry will be provided. A Python script will be included for users to generate their dataset in csv format.
Data migration: Following the dataset generation, the user can ingest the dataset into any database of their choice. However, in this code challenge, I used the Microsoft platform, including SQL-Server, SQL-Server Integration server (SSIS) and SSMS. A step-by-step tutorial has been provided to guide the user migrate the sampled dataset into a relational database (SQL-SERVER).

## Business Cases (10 per week):

Beginner (3 cases): Focus on basic querying skills like filtering, aggregation, and simple joins.
Intermediate (4 cases): Introduce window functions, subqueries, and basic data manipulation techniques.
Advanced (3 cases): Challenge participants with complex joins, data cleansing techniques, and advanced analytical functions.
